// Once you've created a schema you can use it to create models. The model represents a collection of documents in the database that you can search, while the model's instances represent individual documents that you can save and retrieve.

// We provide a brief overview below. For more information see: Models (Mongoose docs).

// Note: Creation, update, deletion and querying of records are asynchronous operations that return a promise. The examples below show just the use of the relevant methods and await (i.e. the essential code for using the methods). The surrounding async function and try...catch block to catch errors are omitted for clarity. For more information on using await/async see Database APIs are asynchronous above.
