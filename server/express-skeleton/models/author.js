// Virtual for author's full name
AuthorSchema.virtual("name").get(function () {
  // To avoid errors in cases where an author does not have either a family name or first name
  // We want to make sure we handle the exception by returning an empty string for that case
  let fullname = "";

// Virtual for author's URL
AuthorSchema.virtual("url").get(function () {
  // We don't use an arrow function as we'll need the this object
  return `/catalog/author/${this._id}`;
});

// Export model
module.exports = mongoose.model("Author", AuthorSchema);


// We've also declared a virtual for the AuthorSchema named "url" that returns the absolute URL required to get a particular instance of the model â€” we'll use the property in our templates whenever we need to get a link to a particular author.

// Note: Declaring our URLs as a virtual in the schema is a good idea because then the URL for an item only ever needs to be changed in one place. At this point, a link using this URL wouldn't work, because we haven't got any routes handling code for individual model instances. We'll set those up in a later article!
