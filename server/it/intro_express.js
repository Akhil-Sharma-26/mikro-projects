const express = require("express");

// The callback function takes a request and a response object as arguments. In this case, the method calls send() on the response to return the string "Hello World!" There are a number of other response methods for ending the request/response cycle, for example, you could call res.json() to send a JSON response or res.sendFile() to send a file.

app.listen(port, function () {
  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}!`);
});
app.all("/secret", function (req, res, next) {
  console.log("Accessing the secret sectionâ€¦");
  next(); // pass control to the next handler
});// There is a special routing method, app.all(), which will be called in response to any HTTP method. This is used for loading middleware functions at a particular path for all request methods.

// The first two lines require() (import) the express module and create an Express application. This object, which is traditionally named app, has methods for routing HTTP requests, configuring middleware, rendering HTML views, registering a template engine, and modifying application settings that control how the application behaves (e.g. the environment mode, whether route definitions are case sensitive, etc.)

// The middle part of the code (the three lines starting with app.get) shows a route definition. The app.get() method specifies a callback function that will be invoked whenever there is an HTTP GET request with a path ('/') relative to the site root. The callback function takes a request and a response object as arguments, and calls send() on the response to return the string "Hello World!"

// The final block starts up the server on a specified port ('3000') and prints a log comment to the console. With the server running, you could go to localhost:3000 in your browser to see the example response returned.
